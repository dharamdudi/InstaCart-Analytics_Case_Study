## Problem Statement
You’re a data analyst at Instacart. Aside from the discounted groceries, you also get the benefit of solving interesting data problems.

In your 1-1 call this morning, your manager tells you that leadership wants to analyze the Instacart market data over time, to understand how the business is changing or staying the same.
Unfortunately, data engineering found some logging errors in the pipeline, and there are currently no date fields in the market data tables 🙃.

Your manager has a call with engineering tomorrow to work on fixing this so the team can track changes more closely in the future.
But you’re already mid-way through Q3 and the data pipeline can’t be refreshed again until Q4. So for now, you’re stuck with the data you have.

### The Task
Find a way to understand how Instacart's business changed over time…without using explicit dates!

## Overview

➡️ Downloaded the original dataset from [instacart kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/instacart-market-basket-analysis/data). Used PostgreSQL with TablePlus to prepare and analyze the data.

➡️ Performed comparative analysis of key order metrics, cart composition patterns, reorder trends, and top performing items. Investigated seasonal influences on fresh produce reorders.

➡️ Formatted the output of the SQL queries in MS-Excel. Also used Excel to build some visualizations to support the finding.

➡️ Finally compiled all the outputs and charts in Figma to present the insights uncovered from the analytics case study.

## Business Recommendations

🔍 Increased produce sales are beneficial for the company, so leadership should capitalize on customers’ higher propensity to reorder produce during the summer months.

🔍 While shopping, after adding first three items to the cart, the shopper should gets recommended with the options of previously bought fresh produce items and also the top performing items.

🔍 If not already implemented, marketing should consider promoting bundle deals on produce to incentivize new buyers, who may then become repeat customers for those products.

🔍 Additionally, team members working with suppliers and grocers should ensure the consistent availability of popular produce items, including Bananas, Strawberries, Avocado, and Broccoli, in order to maintain high reorder rates.
